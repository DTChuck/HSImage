# Summary

- This library is designed to allow open-source experimentation with ENVI-BIL type hyperspectral images. The goal of this software is to promote the study of hyperspectral images in computer vision research by providing an open source, easy to use interface to these hyperspectral images. This software provides both a C++ and Python interface for ease of use. An associated project has resulted in a publicly available library of images available at [https://osf.io/pd49t/](). These images are all compatible and intended to be used with this software interface library.

The software can be found at [https://github.com/DTChuck/HSImage]() and documentation can be found at [https://dtchuck.github.io/HSImage/]().
