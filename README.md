Interface Library for ENVI-BIL Hyperspectral Images
(C++/Python)

This library is designed to allow open-source experimentation with ENVI-BIL hyperspectral images. The goal of this software is to promote the study of hyperspectral images in the academic computer vision research world. This software provides both a C++ and Python interface for ease of use. An associated project has resulted in a publicly available library of images available at https://osf.io/pd49t/. These images are all compatible and intended to be used with this software interface library.
